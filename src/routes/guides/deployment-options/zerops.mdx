[Zerops](https://zerops.io) is a dev-first cloud platform that can be used to deploy both Static and SSR Solid Node.js Apps.

For additional one-to-one support, details, and features, you can join the [Zerops Discord server](https://discord.gg/xxzmJSDKPT) and [visit the Zerops Docs](https://docs.zerops.io).

Deploy and test Zerops Solid recipes with one click:
- [Deploy Solid Node.js](https://app.zerops.io/recipe/solidjs-nodejs) - [Source Repository](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-solidjs-nodejs)
- [Deploy Solid Static](https://app.zerops.io/recipe/solidjs-static) - [Source Repository](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-solidjs-static)


## Setting up an Account on Zerops

1. Go to [Zerosps Registration](https://app.zerops.io/registration) and sign up using GitHub, GitLab, or just your email.

**Note**: If you're on compact mode you wont see a sidebar but use the top navigation bar and if you are on full mode you'll see a sidebar and it'll be easier for you to navigate.

## Setting up your Project Infrastructure

There are two ways to set up a zerops project and a service:

#### Using Project Add Wizard (GUI)

1. Go to your [Zerops dashboard](https://app.zerops.io/dashboard/projects)
2. Add new project using your Sidebar. If you're on compact mode then click on your profile and then Add new project.
3. Now, it will redirect you to a page where you can choose a service.

##### For Static:
1. Choose Static.
2. Scroll down and change the hostname to your preference.
3. Scroll down and click on the "Add New Static" button.

##### For SSR - Node.js:
1. Choose `Node.js` and select `version 20`.
2. Scroll down and change the hostname to your preference.
3. Scroll down and click on the "Add New Node.js" button.

#### Using Project Import YAML

1. Go to your [Zerops dashboard](https://app.zerops.io/dashboard/projects) and click on your profile icon if you are a new user. If not, check your sidebar and click on `Import Project`.

##### Static:
```yaml
project:
  name: recipe-solidjs
  tags:
    - zerops-recipe

services:
  - hostname: app
    type: Static
    enableSubdomainAccess: true
```

##### SSR - Node.js:
```yaml
project:
  name: recipe-solidjs
  tags:
    - zerops-recipe

services:
  - hostname: app
    type: nodejs@20
    enableSubdomainAccess: true
```

## Setting up Zerops Yaml to your Project
Zerops Yaml is supposed to be added to the root of the project which tells Zerops how to build and run the app.

For **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**:

Set up the `zerops.yml` file in the root of your SSR project and make sure the setup parameter's value is supposed to be same as the hostname of the service.

```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: app
    build:
      base: nodejs@20
      buildCommands:
        - pnpm i
        - pnpm build
      deployFiles:
        - .output
        - node_modules
        - public
        - package.json
    run:
      base: nodejs@20
      ports:
        - port: 3000
          httpSupport: true
      start: pnpm start
```

For **SSG (Static Site Generation)**:

Set up the `zerops.yml` file in the root of your SSR project and make sure the setup parameter's value is supposed to be same as the hostname of the service.

```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: app
    build:
      base: nodejs@20
      buildCommands:
        - pnpm i
        - pnpm build
      deployFiles:
        - dist/~
    run:
      base: static
```
Push the changes to your GitHub/GitLab repository (necessary if you are planning to use GitHub/GitLab).

## Triggering the pipeline using Github/Gitlab
You can push your project by [Triggering the pipeline using Zerops CLI](#triggering-the-pipeline-using-githubgitlab) or by connecting the app service with your [GitHub](https://docs.zerops.io/references/github-integration/) / [GitLab](https://docs.zerops.io/references/gitlab-integration) repository from inside the service detail.



## Triggering the pipeline using Zerops CLI (zCLI)

To download the zCLI binary directly, use [zCLI/releases](https://github.com/zeropsio/zcli/releases)
1. Install the Zerops CLI using Terminal.
```bash
npm i -g @zerops/zcli
```
2. Open Settings > [Access Token Management](https://app.zerops.io/settings/token-management) in the Zerops app and generate a new access token.
3. Log in using your access token with the following command:
```bash
zcli login <token>
```
4. Navigate to the root of your app (where zerops.yml is located) and run the following command in Terminal to trigger the deploy:
```bash
zcli push
```

Feel free to check out the [Zerops Docs](http://docs.zerops.io/) and if you're confused by this guide.
