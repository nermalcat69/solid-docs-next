[Zerops](https://zerops.io) is a dev-first cloud platform that can be used to deploy both Static and SSR Solid Node.js Apps.

For additional one-to-one support, details, and features, you can join the [Zerops Discord server](https://discord.gg/xxzmJSDKPT) and [visit the Zerops Docs](https://docs.zerops.io).

Deploy and test Zerops Solid recipes with one click:
- [Deploy Solid Node.js](https://app.zerops.io/recipe/solidjs-nodejs) - [Source Repository](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-solidjs-nodejs)
- [Deploy Solid Static](https://app.zerops.io/recipe/solidjs-static) - [Source Repository](https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-solidjs-static)


## Project Import using YAML
**Note:** Make sure the project has `zerops.yml` in the root.

Using project import YAML, you can import any GitHub repository by simply replacing the repo URL, and it will build the whole project if it has a correct `zerops.yml`.

Project import YAML can only be utilized if the repository is public and has `zerops.yml` in the root; otherwise, you'll encounter an error.

```yaml
project:
  name: recipe-solidjs
  tags:
    - zerops-recipe

services:
  - hostname: app
    type: nodejs@20
    enableSubdomainAccess: true
    buildFromGit: https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-solidjs-nodejs
```

Go to your [Zerops dashboard](https://app.zerops.io/dashboard/projects) and click on your profile icon if you are a new user. If not, check your sidebar and click on 'Import Project.'


## Using the Zerops web interface
**Note**:
1. Go to [Zerops website](https://zerops.io), navigate to the header, and click on sign up using GitHub, GitLab, or your email. You will see a dashboard (welcome screen for a new user) with one-click deploy buttons and a project creation button (for old users who already have projects ~ check your sidebar and make sure you have full mode on instead of compact mode) with a textarea to create a new project.
2. Now, it will redirect you to a page where you can choose a service.

For **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**:

1. Choose `Node.js` and select `version 20`.
2. Scroll down and change the hostname to your preference.
3. Scroll down and click on the "Add New Node.js" button.

Set up the zerops.yml file in the root of your SSR project.

```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: app
    build:
      base: nodejs@20
      buildCommands:
        - pnpm i
        - pnpm build
      deployFiles:
        - .output
        - node_modules
        - public
        - package.json
    run:
      base: nodejs@20
      ports:
        - port: 3000
          httpSupport: true
      start: pnpm start
```

For **SSG (Static Site Generation)**:

1. Choose Static.
2. Scroll down and change the hostname to your preference.
3. Scroll down and click on the "Add New Static" button.

Set up the `zerops.yml` file in the root of your static project
```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: app
    build:
      base: nodejs@20
      buildCommands:
        - pnpm i
        - pnpm build
      deployFiles:
        - dist/~
    run:
      base: static
```
Push the changes to your GitHub/GitLab repository (necessary if you are planning to use GitHub/GitLab).

## Triggering the pipeline using Github/Gitlab
You can push your project by [Triggering the pipeline using Zerops CLI](#triggering-the-pipeline-using-githubgitlab) or by connecting the app service with your [GitHub](https://docs.zerops.io/references/github-integration/) / [GitLab](https://docs.zerops.io/references/gitlab-integration) repository from inside the service detail.



## Triggering the pipeline using Zerops CLI (zCLI)

To download the zCLI binary directly, use [zCLI/releases](https://github.com/zeropsio/zcli/releases)
1. Install the Zerops CLI using Terminal.
```bash
npm i -g @zerops/zcli
```
2. Open Settings > [Access Token Management](https://app.zerops.io/settings/token-management) in the Zerops app and generate a new access token.
3. Log in using your access token with the following command:
```bash
zcli login <token>
```
4. Navigate to the root of your app (where zerops.yml is located) and run the following command in Terminal to trigger the deploy:
```bash
zcli push
```
